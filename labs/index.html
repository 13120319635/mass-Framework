<p>黄暴台：目前剧集党逐渐壮大，作为原著党供奉的神，你有何感想？
</p><p>George R.R. Martin We really have two audiences now, which is a unique challenge for a TV show. We have the viewers who are coming to the TV show without any knowledge of the books. And we have the readers, who have read the books, many times in many cases. Sometimes those two audiences give very different reactions to the same things. For the viewers experiencing it for the first time, it's just a matter of, "Is it exciting? Is it involving?" The readers care about those things, too, but they're also saying, "Well, this is how it was in the books ..."
</p><p>坑神：说是神，也是坑神而已。最闹心的就是一群无知的剧集党连书皮都没碰过就来原著党面前嚷嚷，讲道理求剧透神马的，你要知道原著党都是深入体验我（的书）多少遍的粉丝鸟。有的时候看这帮无知的小小鸟叽叽喳喳特别的蛋疼。尤其是那些新人，就知道问一些“这书爽么？能完爆暮光之城不？”之类的废话，而高贵冷艳的原著党就会谆谆教诲，“剧集右转，油麻斯比妞”。
</p><p>HBO You wrote the script for the episode "Blackwater," which aired recently -- was it difficult for you to translate your vision from the books onto the screen?
</p><p>黄暴台：你给《黑水大战》这集写了剧本，把原著内容改编给我们最爱的电视台付费用户是否让你纠结？
</p><p>George R.R. Martin It's very difficult. Prose and film have different techniques and weapons that they use. In a book, I have internal monologue and can give you access to a character's thoughts. He can tell a lie, but you're in his head, so you know he's lying. While you're watching on the screen, you're just hearing what he's saying -- the actor has to sell it with his eyes and the set of his mouth. And great actors can do that. Each of these mediums has its own strengths and weaknesses, and when you're moving from one to the other, it's always a challenge. If you look at the Battle of the Blackwater in the books, it occupies seven or eight chapters, intercutting from three points of view. If you shot it as I wrote it in the book, it would cost $100 million and take two months to shoot.
</p><p>坑神：灰常的纠结！写书写剧本采用的表达方式完全不一样。在书里你可以直接读出人物的心理，如果他撒谎，你能知道他在撒谎。但是如果你看剧，你就会很蛋疼的发现，你得通过他们的表情和语气神马的推断出这些东西。书和影视都有长短处，做成影视内容必然要有修改。如果你是原著党，会发现它使用三个POV来讲述，占用七八个章节。如果忠于原书拍摄，他们可能觉得还不如去开发iOS游戏呢。
</p><p>HBO And the entire story is so complex. When you're working on the books, how difficult is it to weigh and keep track of all your decisions?
</p><p>黄暴台：你说的我头都大了，这书这么牛逼，这么庞大，你写书时脑袋不迷糊么？
</p><p>George R.R. Martin Sometimes I make the decisions wrongly. My process as a writer is not one of thoroughly outlining ahead of time, which can result in my muse leading me down blind alleys and dead ends. I write a chapter and it seems great in and of itself, but then I realize a month later or half a year later that I don't want to go down that street. So then I have to double back and rewrite and so forth. It's almost a subconscious thing -- when it's right, it feels right, and when it doesn't feel right, I keep niggling at it until it does.
</p><p>坑神：不迷糊的后来都疯掉或者早逝了。有时候我觉得有些章节写的很牛逼，但过几个月才能发觉当时犯二的地方，这时候就得优雅地回去推倒重练。作为一个文艺青年（误），我最注重感觉，感觉好才是真的好。不走寻常路，美特斯邦威。
</p><p>HBO In the season finale, one of everyone's favorite characters, Tyrion Lannister, finds himself in a miserable position. Was it hard for you to smack him down so quickly after his moment of triumph?
</p><p>黄暴台：第二季最后，最受观众欢迎的角色<a href="/index.php?title=%E6%8F%90%E5%88%A9%E6%98%82%C2%B7%E5%85%B0%E5%B0%BC%E6%96%AF%E7%89%B9&amp;variant=zh-cn" title="提利昂·兰尼斯特">彼特·丁拉基</a>矮矬富直接变成屌丝，观众纷纷受不了，纷纷问道，“把角色虐的这么厉害，这是人干的事么？”
</p><p>George R.R. Martin Well, you know, you don't want to make it too easy for the characters. If the character just goes from success to success, then you don't have much of a story, now do you? But I guess it's one of my trademarks as an author to always ask the question, "OK, what next?" We see a lot of books and movies and television shows, where you see some situation come up and then the resolution of it along pretty traditional -- or even stereotypical -- lines. That's great, but what happens next? We see this with Theon and taking Winterfell. "OK, Theon, you very cleverly tricked the Starks. Singers will sing of this for hundreds of years ... What's next? How do you hang onto this?" That question, on a whole bunch of levels, has always fascinated me, and there's a lot of that in "A Song of Ice and Fire."
</p><p>坑神：你懂的，角色就是用来虐的啦。主角光环神马的太无聊了喵~不过貌似多数人也没我写的这么变态，唉~适应了就好了啦~就像我写书，总在想，哦，这个家伙走到这了，下一步呢？要是下一步没啥转折我就把它写死好了~省着写成大众角色大家都不舒服。比如说小鱿鱼占领临冬城，哦，了不起，然后呢？了不起就完了么？所以你懂的，苦逼的人就是这样产生的。我最喜欢思考这些问题，怎么样让角色更苦逼。所以说，冰火里充满了苦逼角色。
</p><p>HBO One final question on behalf of all your fans -- how's the next book coming?
</p><p>黄暴台：最后一个问题，你有在写书么？
</p><p>George R.R. Martin I'm working on that, and a number of "Ice and Fire" related things at the same time. Not only "The Winds of Winter," which is Book 6, but we're also coming out with a big concordance called "The World of Ice and Fire," which is about the whole history of Westeros and will be lavishly illustrated. So I've been filling in some of the histories of the kings who ruled 200 years ago or 500 years ago. We've also been doing a map book, and I'm working on a new novella about Dunk and Egg, the prequel series I have. It's a slow process the way I write, especially books of this size that are as large and complex as they are. It's still a slow process. I am aware of the TV series moving along behind me like a giant locomotive, and I know I need to lay the track more quickly, perhaps, because the locomotive is soon going to be bearing down on me. The last thing I want is for the TV series to catch up with me. I've got a considerable headstart, but production is moving faster than I can write. I'm hoping that we'll finish the story at about the same time... we'll see.
</p><p>坑神：我……呃……其实，有在写啦~其实我也在多线程处理一些冰火相关东东呢……除了第六本《那年冬天吹的风》，我也在倒弄一个叫做《冰火世界》的东西，丰富描述了维斯特洛全部历史。我在填补两百年前，五百年前这种时间段的一些King的故事。我们也在搞地图册（地铁上三元一本那种东东），邓肯和鸡蛋的趣味中篇也要出续集。我写东西的速度……呃……呃…………你们懂的……………………尤其是冰火这种………………呃…………………………………我就不说啥了。电视台在我后面使劲改编拍剧就跟拿着鞭子抽我一样，这么说我不快点写书好像有点对不起大家……呃………………我也不想电视剧赶到我前面，剧集党给原著党剧透神马的最讨厌了！！！虽然确实剧集党的高潮确实比原著党来得快，但原著党往往比较猛烈，如果愿意也可以多重高潮………………唉…………我一直希望最终原著党和剧集党能一起迎来高潮呢（快点结束访谈，我得查查下一个宴会的日程，哇~好多食物好期待……）
